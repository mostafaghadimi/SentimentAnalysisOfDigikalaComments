The growth of pre-trained language models has opened a new era in Natural Language Processing (NLP), allowing us to build powerful language models. Transformer-based models, such as BERT, have grown in popularity as a result of their cutting-edge performance. These models, however, are often centred on English, leaving other languages to multilingual models with minimal resources. 
In this thesis, the preceding models have been reviewed in details and proposed a new creative model using BERT and machine learning algorithms for two major purposes. The latter is to handle automatic handling (reject/accept) the comments and the former is the main topic of the thesis. This proposal is a real world example of research in industry, which helps Digikala company to automatically handle the procedures.
